In this project, we are concerned with whether seasonal effects or other factors play a part in the rise and fall of the financial identity theft rate in Chicago throughout the year. Although financial identity theft does not seem like a major offense, but it is one of the most reported crime in Chicago. Predicting the behavior of those theft criminals could hugely benefit the government agencies in preventing future offenses. In this project, we will be using the 'Crimes in Chicago' dataset from Kaggle, which comprise of Chicago crime data dating from 2001 to 2017.

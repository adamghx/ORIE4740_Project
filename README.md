In this project, we are concerned with what factors attribute to a person having heart disease. Heart disease is a chronic disease that takes vast amount of resources to treat, and handled inproperly could take away someone life unknownly. By figuring out which factors have the most probabilities of leading to heart diseases, we could monitor those factors for patients, and thus prevent heart disease. For this project, we would seek to build a predictive model using data from the 'Cardiovascular Disease dataset' from Kaggle, which contain heart disease information of 70,000 patients.
